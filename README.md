This SQL project primarily focuses on analyzing global health data from two main tables: disease_data and country_data, which are part of the project_dataset database. The project delves into various health indicators and demographics across different countries, with a particular emphasis on the year 2015. The analysis spans both 'Developed' and 'Developing' countries, providing insights into public health challenges, economic factors, and their implications. Here's a breakdown of the project's components and their objectives:

Highest GDP in Developed Countries: This part identifies the countries classified as 'Developed' with the highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP), offering insights into the economic standing of these nations.

Death Percentage in Developing Countries: It calculates the death rate in 'Developing' countries based on adult mortality and population data, highlighting public health challenges in these regions.

Lowest Infant Death Percentage in Developed Countries (2015): This analysis focuses on 'Developed' countries in 2015, identifying those with the lowest percentage of infant deaths relative to their populations, indicating the effectiveness of healthcare systems in these nations.

Infant Death Percentage by Country (2010): It examines the infant mortality rate across all countries in 2010, providing a comparative analysis of child healthcare effectiveness worldwide.

BMI to Thinness Ratio in Developed Countries (2015): This part assesses the nutritional status in 'Developed' countries by comparing Body Mass Index (BMI) with thinness rates among children aged 5-9 years in 2015, offering insights into dietary and health challenges.

Maximum Income Composition of Resources (2015): It identifies the highest income composition of resources in 2015, a metric that can reflect a country's economic diversification and standard of living.

Total Hepatitis B Percentage (2015): This analysis calculates the global burden of Hepatitis B in 2015 by determining the percentage of the population affected by the disease, highlighting public health priorities.

Cumulative Hepatitis B Cases (2015): Using a Common Table Expression (CTE), it assesses the cumulative number of Hepatitis B cases by country in 2015, alongside demographic and economic indicators, to gauge the disease's impact relative to population and economic conditions.

Cumulative Measles Cases and Population Percentage (2015): Another CTE-based analysis that focuses on Measles cases in 2015, calculating the percentage of the population affected by the disease, underscoring the importance of vaccination and public health measures.

Percent Population Affected View (2015): This part creates a view in the database to facilitate future analyses. The view encompasses data on Measles and Hepatitis B cases, along with population figures for 2015, to compute the percentage of the population affected by these diseases.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of various health indicators, economic factors, and their interplay, offering valuable insights for policymakers, public health officials, and researchers interested in global health trends and challenges. The project's focus on specific years allows for targeted analysis, while the creation of a view for future use demonstrates foresight in data management and application.
